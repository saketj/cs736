\textit{Fast non-volatile memories (NVM) are byte addressable, offer latencies close to DRAM and have densities better than DRAM. This allows applications to persist their data close to memory latencies in NVM, but at a higher predicted cost per byte. On the other hand, the I/O latency of a disk-based filesystem is much higher than a pure memory-based filesystem, though memory-based filesystems are limited by their storage cost. We propose a hybrid approach, where we use NVM as a primary storage and flash/disk as secondary storage. This paper provides the design and implementation of a tiered filesystem for a persistent storage that includes both NVM and disks.}
