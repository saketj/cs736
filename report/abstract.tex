\begin{abstract}
Fast non-volatile memories (NVM) are byte addressable, offer latencies close to DRAM and have densities better than DRAM that allow applications to persist their data close to memory latencies, but at a higher predicted cost per byte. The I/O latency of a disk-based filesystem is higher than a pure memory-based filesystem, but memory-based filesystems are limited by their storage cost. We propose a hybrid approach, where we use NVM as a primary storage and use flash/disk-based for secondary storage. Our approach is to combine the low latency of NVM and low cost of disk-based storage without regressing on the performance and still offer similar consistency guarantees.
