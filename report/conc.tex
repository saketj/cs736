\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec-conc}

Future commodity systems could potentially have NVM as an integral part of the storage tier just as in the case of DRAM in current systems, though the capacity of NVM could be limited and may vary drastically. AC-BPFS provides a file system design that scales well and tunes itself according to the capacity of the individual memory devices in the storage tier, but at the same time provides consistency guarantees without replicating data across storage devices and still performs well. The policies used in both anti-cache manager and disk manager can be modified independently depending on the workload characteristics of the system.

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec-conc}

We identify several opportunities to extend this work in future. In this paper we did not get to do a thorough analysis on impacts and effects of hotness and coldness of data using multiple workloads and macro-benchmarks. We believe that doing so will reveal several potential areas to improve the system both functionally and architecturally. It is very important that we extensively evaluate and analyze crash consistency and reliability issues for this system in depth before extending the system. Lastly, since we simulated the NVM in DRAM, we did not get to evaluate the effects of persistent LRU cache on the performance of the system. Persistent LRU cache could have a significant effect on different aspects of the file system, such as boot time, that remains yet to be studied.
